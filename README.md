#Question_2
Count number of On bits in binary representation of a decimal number.                               
I was confused about checking set bit in absolute of an integer or to type cast it to unsigned and  then find number of set bit in a type casted unsigned integer . I had solved it for absolute of integer.If required then i can solve it for type casted unsigned integer as well.
